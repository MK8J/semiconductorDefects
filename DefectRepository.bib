High-resolution Laplace capacitance spectroscopy with the uniaxial stress technique has been used to measure the stress-energy tensor and the results are compared with theoretical modeling. At low temperatures, implanted H is trapped as a negative-U center with a donor level in the upper half of the gap. However, at higher temperatures, H migrates closer to the carbon impurity and the donor level falls, crossing the gap. At the same time, an acceptor level is introduced into the upper gap making the defect a positive-U center.},

  abstract = {We report the observation of a novel example of defect metastability in silicon. The phenomenon, monitored by deep-level transient spectroscopy, takes place at a well-identified point defect, i.e., the interstitial-iron\textendash{}substitutional-aluminum pair (Fe(i)Al(s)). The charge state of the defect during sample cooldown to low temperature is found to control a reversible transmutation behavior between two defect energy levels, at EV+0.20 eV (H1) and EV+0.13 eV (H2). A kinetic study of the transformation has led to a detailed microscopic description of the phenomenon. It is shown to arise from a charge-state-controlled, electrostatically driven, reorientation of Fe(i)Al(s) pairs between {$\langle$}111{$\rangle$} and {$\langle$}100{$\rangle$} configurations. Levels H1 and H2 are thus ascribed to (Fe(i))2+-(Fe(i))+ transitions at the nearest and next-nearest tetrahedral sites adjacent to aluminum, respectively. A configuration-coordinate (CC) description of the center, based on the simple ionic model of iron-acceptor pairs, is shown to account for all features of the reaction. No very large lattice relaxation is needed to understand the phenomenon. The CC model of the Fe(i)Al(s) pair is then extended to non-purely-ionic defect complexes. A complete new class of metastable centers is thus proposed. Metastable phenomena involving other semiconductor defects (A center in silicon, EL2 center in GaAs, M center in InP) are discussed in the light of these new CC models.},

This center introduces two deep donor-hole traps in the band gap, at EV+0.50 eV (H1) and EV+0.36 eV (H2), as revealed by deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). We find that each C center may contribute to either of the two hole-emission signals H1 and H2 in a DLTS scan, but not both, and that the one it contributes to depends upon its charge state during sample cooling down to low temperatures. We present a simple double-site configuration-coordinate model of the defect that explains these unusual observations. In this model, the C center can exist in either of two configurations in both of its charge states; each configuration is stable in one charge state. No very large lattice relaxation effect is involved. The C center is then tentatively identified as a boron-vacancy pair (B-V), a defect which has eluded DLTS detection so far. We show how this microscopic model is supported by the results of previous defect studies in ultra-fast-quenched and electron-irradiated silicon. The two donor levels H1 and H2 are thus tentatively ascribed to next-nearest- and nearest-neighbor B-V pairs, respectively.},

A search was made for other levels associated with gold centers but none were found. The distribution coefficient for gold in silicon is 2.5\texttimes{}10-5. Gold was introduced into the crystals by growing from a gold-doped melt and by diffusion into single crystals at high temperatures. The concentrations of gold observed in solution after saturation at various temperatures is consistent with that expected from the distribution coefficient. Gold acts as a recombination center detectable at concentrations as low as 1012 per cm3. Because the acceptor level is so close to the center of the forbidden band, it is possible to shift the Fermi level below the middle with large ratios of gold to residual donors. The acceptor level is measured in p-type silicon as 0.62 ev from the valence band, giving a value of band gap consistent with previous measurements by other methods.},

  abstract = {Iron introduces a donor level into silicon at 0.40 ev from the valence band observed both in crystals doped in the melt and in crystals into which iron was diffused at 1200\textdegree{}C. This level converts anomalously to a level 0.55 ev from the conduction band on standing at room temperature. The conversion is reversible in the range {$\sim$}70\textdegree{}-200\textdegree{}C; above 200\textdegree{}C, the electrical activity of iron irreversibly disappears. No evidence for acceptor action of iron was found. The electrically active solubility of iron, 1.5\texttimes{}1016 cm-3 at 1200\textdegree{}C, is higher than the radiotracer solubility but the former was measured in more rapidly quenched samples. The distribution coefficient is 8\texttimes{}10-6. Preferential trapping of electrons by iron centers was shown by Hall mobility measurements on optically-excited charge carriers. Lifetime studies by the photoconductive decay method indicated a larger capture cross section for electrons than for holes.},

An unidentified peak was detected in an n-type epitaxial layer by DLTS with an activation energy and capture cross-section of 0.255 eV and 3.5 \texttimes{} 10-16 cm2, respectively. These results were consistent with measurements of n-type silicon implanted with Mo. A p-type epitaxial wafer was exposed to the same epitaxial growth environment resulting in the detection of the Mo-d level, thus confirming the Mo contamination. The change in the enthalpy of the capture of electrons into the unidentified level was 14 meV resulting in the majority carrier capture cross-section being determined to be 1.2 \texttimes{} 10-16 cm2 assuming a multi-phonon process. Using the activation energy and enthalpy change of capture cross-section data, the change in Gibbs free energy as a function of temperature was calculated to be Ec-0.269 eV. Poole-Frenkel effect measurements determined the deep level to be an acceptor-like state. The total change in entropy was determined to be 1k, the first reported total entropy change for an acceptor level of a 4d transition metal. The measured enthalpy energy was in reasonable agreement with the reported theoretical calculation of a substitution Mo-a deep level.},

  abstract = {The effects of various metallic impurities, both singly and in combinations, on the performance of silicon solar cells have been studied. Czochralski crystals were grown with controlled additions of secondary impurities. The primary dopants were boron and phosphorus while the secondaires were: A1, B, C, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Nb, P, Pd, Ta, Ti, V, W, Zn, and Zr. Impurity concentrations ranged from 1010to 1017/cm3. Solar cells were made using a conventional diffusion process and were characterized by computer reduction ofI-Vdata. The collected data indicated that impurity-induced performance loss was primarily due to reduction of the base diffusion length. Based on this observation, an analytic model was developed which predicts cell performance as a function of the secondary impurity concentrations. The calculated performance parameters are in good agreement with measured values except for Cu, Ni, and Fe, which at higher concentrations, degrade the cell substantially by means of junction mechanisms. This behavior can be distinguished from base diffusion length effects by careful analysis of theI-Vdata. The effects of impurities in n-base and p-base devices differ in degree but submit to the same modeling analysis. A comparison of calculated and measured performance for multiple impurities indicates a limited interaction between impurities, e.g., copper appears to improve titanium-doped cells.},

Zusammenfassung
Die Rekombination von L{\"o}chern und Elektronen durch Goldzentren in Silizium ist bestimmt durch zwei Rekombinations-Energieniveaus, n{\"a}mlich einen Donator und einen Akzeptor, sowie vier Einfangwahrscheinlichkeiten. Durch Vergleichen des Abklingens der Photoleitf{\"a}higkeit bei kleiner Tr{\"a}gerkonzentration in golddotierten Siliziumproben mit einem theoretischen Ausdruck, der von einer nichstation{\"a}ren L{\"o}sung des Rekombinationsproblems abgeleitet wurde, haben wir folgende Werte f{\"u}r diese Wahrscheinlichkeiten bestimmt: AkzeptorniveauDonatorniveau{$\alpha$}n = 1,65 \texttimes{} 10-9cm3/sec{$\beta$}n = 6,3 \texttimes{} 10-8cm3/sec{$\alpha$}p = 1,15 \texttimes{} 10-7cm3/sec{$\beta$}p = 2,4 \texttimes{} 10-8cm3/sec Diese Ergebnisse wurden benutzt, um bei grosser Tr{\"a}gerkonzentration die Lebensdauer von Minorit{\"a}tstr{\"a}gern zu ermitteln, die dann mit den Lebensdauern verglichen wurden, die empirisch aus Messungen der Dioden-Speicherzeit bestimmt wurden. Es wurde eine gute {\"U}bereinstimmung gefunden, die beweist, dass die Speicherzeit von Dioden mit Erfolg vorhergesagt werden kann.},

  abstract = {Infra-red absorption in semiconductors is classified into four different types according to the mechanism: (i) intrinsic absorption associated with electron excitation across the energy gap; (ii) absorption due to the presence of free carriers; (iii) absorption associated with impurities or lattice defects; and (iv) absorption associated with lattice vibration. A general introduction is followed by some theoretical discussions. Electron excitation between different energy bands is discussed with emphasis on the intrinsic absorption edge. For the absorption by free carriers, the effects of electron scattering by lattice vibration and by impurity centres are considered. Absorption associated with localized electronic states is briefly discussed. Experimental results are discussed for four different semiconductors: germanium, silicon, indium antimonide, and tellurium. All four types of absorption have been investigated to some extent for germanium and silicon. The work done on these materials provides a pattern for infra-red studies on semiconductors. The absorption edge in indium antimonide is affected by the carrier concentration. Long wave-length absorption shows interesting behaviour, and the observed effects attributed to lattice vibration have provided information regarding the type of binding in the crystal. Tellurium, having an optical axis, is doubly refracting. Both the absorption edge and the absorption associated with free carriers depend on the direction of polarization of the radiation.},

Several defect levels are observed by deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) in n- and p-type samples. All defects levels are related to sulfur defects, but none could be identified with the donor and double donor states of substitutional S or molecular S2. Additional annealing of the samples at 300 \textdegree{}C generates four DLTS levels in n-type Si and no peaks in p-type Si. The enhancement of the emission rate with the electrical field confirm their donor and double donor-like behavior. The authors identify the four DLTS levels in the annealed n-type Si samples with the different charge states of monoatomic S and molecular S2 (S0, S+, S20, and S2+) defects in Si. Hydrogenation of the annealed samples by wet chemical etching results in a reduction of the intensity of S0, S+, S20, and S2+ due to a passivation of these defects. The authors did not observe any electrically active SH-complexes in the hydrogenated samples.},

  abstract = {This paper first describes the quantitative determination of the static and dynamic properties of the locally stable states of monatomic hydrogen dissolved in crystalline silicon: H+, H0, and H-. The monatomic hydrogens were created controllably near room temperature by using hole-stimulated dissociation of phosphorus-hydrogen (PH) complexes. Drift velocities and charge-change rates were studied via time-resolved capacitance-transient measurements in Schottky diodes under changes of bias. These data enable the donor level {$\varepsilon$}D of 2H to be located at {$\sim$}0.16 eV below the conduction band (confirming that the E3{${'}$} center found in proton-implanted Si corresponds to interstitial H in undamaged Si), and the acceptor level {$\varepsilon$}A at {$\sim$}0.07 eV below midgap, so that hydrogen is a ``negative-U'' system. The experimental values of {$\varepsilon$}D and {$\varepsilon$}A are consistent with predictions from first-principles calculations, which also provide detailed potential-energy surfaces for hydrogen in each charge state. While the phonon-mediated reaction H0\textrightarrow{}H++e- is fast, the reaction H-\textrightarrow{}H0+e- has an activation energy {$\sim$}0.84 eV, well above the energy difference ({$\sim$}0.47 eV) between initial and final states. Our experiments also yielded diffusion coefficients near room temperature for 1H+, 2H+, and 2H-. The asymmetrical positioning of {$\varepsilon$}D and {$\varepsilon$}A in the gap accounts for many previously unexplained effects. For example, it is shown to be responsible for the much greater difficulty of passivating phosphorus-doped than comparably boron-doped Si. And while modest hole concentrations dissociate PH complexes rapidly at temperatures where thermal dissociation takes years, we could not detect an analogous dissociation of BH complexes by minority electrons, a process that is expected to be frustrated by the rapid thermal ionization of H0. The distribution of hydrogen in n-on-n epitaxial layers hydrogenated at 300 \textdegree{}C can be accounted for if the donor-hydrogen complexes are in thermal equilibrium with H2 complexes whose binding energy (relative to H++H-) is of the order of 1.75 eV. With this binding energy, the measured migration of H2 at 200 \textdegree{}C and below must be by diffusion without dissociation.},

The photoionization cross sections are well described by Lucovsky's model. The hole capture by H1 is temperature dependent; a barrier of 40 meV is measured. However, multiphonon emission mechanism cannot be invoked to explain this temperature dependence due to the inferred zero lattice relaxation. The source of iron contamination is found to be the ambient conditions, in particular the quartz tube. The conflicting reports regarding the stability and the variation in the reported capture cross section values suggests that the observed Ev + 0.4 eV level must be a complex centre. The inferred near zero lattice relaxation during the electron transition implies weak coupling to the host lattice.},

  abstract = {This article is the first in a series of two reviews on the properties of iron in silicon. It offers a comprehensive summary of the current state of understanding of fundamental physical properties of iron and its complexes in silicon. The first section of this review discusses the position of iron in the silicon lattice and the electrical properties of interstitial iron. Updated expressions for the solubility and the diffusivity of iron in silicon are presented, and possible explanations for conflicting experimental data obtained by different groups are discussed. The second section of the article considers the electrical and the structural properties of complexes of interstitial iron with shallow accepters (boron, aluminum, indium, gallium, and thallium), shallow donors (phosphorus and arsenic) and other impurities (gold, silver, platinum, palladium, zinc, sulfur, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen). Special attention is paid to the kinetics of iron pairing with shallow accepters, the dissociation of these pairs, and the metastability of iron-acceptor pairs. The parameters of iron-related defects in silicon are summarized in tables that include more than 30 complexes of iron as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and almost 20 energy levels in the band gap associated with iron. The data presented in this review illustrate the enormous complexing activity of iron, which is attributed to the partial or complete (depending on the temperature and the conductivity type) ionization of iron as well as the high diffusivity of iron in silicon. It is shown that studies of iron in silicon require exceptional cleanliness of experimental facilities and highly reproducible diffusion and temperature ramping (quenching) procedures. Properties of iron that are not yet completely understood and need further research are outlined.},

In agreement with what has been found by electron spin resonance (EPR), kind and density of the detected localized states strongly change with deformation temperature and during anneal around 0.6 Tm (Tm melting temperature). While part of this effect can be certainly explained by anneal out of point defects, there must be a structural change in the core region of the dislocation, since the dislocation density remains unchanged during anneal.},

  abstract = {We report detailed measurements of the thermal and optical properties of the well-known gold-acceptor level in silicon. From a comparison of these properties measured in two types of silicon p+n diodes (one fabricated from epitaxially grown silicon and the other from silicon grown by the Czochrolski technique), we find that there are at least two (and perhaps more) different types of gold-acceptor centers in silicon. Measurements of the ratio of the deep-level transient spectroscopy signal due to the gold-donor level to that of the gold acceptor in the same sample show that these two levels are not related to the same gold center, as had previously been believed. A comparison with data in the literature for five other approximately midgap levels in silicon (Ag, Co, Rh, S, and process-induced levels) shows that the electron thermal-emission rates of these are all identical to that of the gold acceptor within experimental error. This suggests that these deep levels have the same underlying defect structure. Comparisons of our measured electron-capture cross sections with those reported in the literature for the gold acceptor show a heretofore unreported correlation between the magnitude of this cross section and the ratio of gold concentration to that of the shallow donor impurity. This suggests that ion pairing between gold acceptors and shallow donors plays a role in determining the capture cross section of the defect. We also have measured for the first time the capture cross sections associated with the gold-donor defect in n-type material and find results significantly different from those reported in the literature for p-type silicon. The optical cross sections of the gold acceptor show nearly a factor of 10 difference in magnitude and subtle differences in shape between epitaxial and Czochrolski samples. It is therefore possible that oxygen is also playing a role in the gold-based defect complexes. Attempts to obtain the temperature dependence of the gold-acceptor level from thermal capture and emission data proved inconclusive and led to various paradoxes which we discuss. Finally, we discuss possible models for gold-related defect complexes which are consistent with our results and might form the basis for future work.},

  abstract = {Float zone silicon (FZ-Si) is typically assumed to be an extremely high quality material, with high minority carrier lifetimes and low concentrations of recombination active defects. However, minority carrier lifetime in FZ-Si has previously been shown to be unstable following thermal treatments between 450 and 700\,\textdegree{}C, with a range of unidentified deep level states being linked to reduced carrier lifetime. There are suspicions that nitrogen doping, which occurs from the growth atmosphere, and intrinsic point defects play a role in the degradation. This study aims to address this by using deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), minority carrier transient spectroscopy, Laplace DLTS, and photoluminescence lifetime measurements to study recombination active defects in nitrogen-doped and nitrogen-lean n-type FZ-Si samples. We find that nitrogen-doped samples experience increased degradation due to higher concentrations of deep level defects during thermal treatments compared to nitrogen-lean samples. In an attempt to explain this difference, in-diffusion of nickel has been used as a marker to demonstrate the existence of higher vacancy concentrations in the nitrogen-doped samples. The origin of the recombination active defects responsible for the thermally induced lifetime degradation in FZ-Si crystals is discussed.},

The emission time constant {$\tau$}e and the capture time constant {$\tau$}c are measured by making use of the sharply peaked impurity distribution obtained by ion implantation. Two techniques are employed:1) the temperature variation of the emission time constant {$\tau$}e is measured assuming a temperature-independent capture cross-section and 2) the ratio {$\tau$}e/{$\tau$}c is determined at a fixed temperature. Capture cross-sections for Be ({$\sigma$}p = 4.20 \texttimes{}10-15 cm2) and Ir ({$\sigma$}n = 7.28 \texttimes{} 10-16 cm2) are reported for the first time. The value for the gold acceptor level ({$\sigma$}n = 2.18 \texttimes{} 10-15 cm2) agrees with values known from the literature. The capture cross-sections for the gold donor level ({$\sigma$}p = 1.04 \texttimes{} 10-18 cm2) and an additional level near the conduction band are probably affected by radiation damage.},

The levels are very close to each other and close to the acceptor level of the PV defect (the E-center) as well. In order to separate them, we have applied the high-resolution technique of Laplace DLTS and compared the formation and annealing properties of defects generated by implantation of hydrogen or helium. We further applied Laplace DLTS in combination with uniaxial stress to study the acceptor level at Ec-Et=0.31eV previously assigned to a vacancy-hydrogen\textendash{}oxygen defect. We find, in accordance with recent EPR measurements, that the defect displays orthorhombic-I symmetry and rule out that it contains two hydrogen atoms. The defect can be understood as a single hydrogen atom bound inside the A-center, the well-known VO defect of silicon, and we denote it VOH accordingly. The observed orthorhombic-I symmetry arises because the hydrogen atom (at T=160K) swiftly jumps among two equivalent sites across the (110) plane that contains the Si\textendash{}O\textendash{}Si bond. Previous studies have shown that hydrogenation of oxygen-rich electron-irradiated samples leads to the formation of VOH with simultaneous depletion of the A-center. Our structural data are in accordance with this dynamic behavior.},

Two DLTS signals, labeled E3{${'}$} and E3'', originate from hydrogen-related donor centers. The electron emission rates of the donors are similar and the two signals are discernible only because they form and anneal differently. In n-type silicon, the E3{${'}$} and E3'' centers transform into negatively charged centers at {$\sim$}100 K and at {$\lessequivlnt$}65 K, respectively. Both signals can be regenerated at 65 K: E3{${'}$} by forward-bias injection of holes and E3'' by illumination with band-gap light under reverse-bias conditions. During the E3{${'}$} regeneration long-range migration of hydrogen occurs, whereas E3'' regenerates without migration. In the space-charge layer of reverse biased diodes, E3{${'}$} converts into E3'' with an activation enthalpy of 0.44 eV in oxygen-rich material, whereas E3'' converts into E3{${'}$} with an activation enthalpy of 0.72 eV in oxygen-poor material. It is found that the density of hydrogen sites associated with E3'' approximately equals the oxygen concentration, whereas the density of E3{${'}$} sites is about 1023cm-3. These results provide further evidence for our previous assignment of E3{${'}$} to isolated hydrogen at a bond center site and leads to the assignment of E3'' to bond centered hydrogen perturbed by a nearby oxygen atom. We argue that dilated Si-Si bonds in the strain fields around impurities and defects are trapping sites for hydrogen.},

Concerning the defect related to the iron-boron pair, the study unambiguously identifies the deep FeB acceptor level as the dominant FeB recombination center. While the known average value EC\textendash{}Et=(0.26{$\pm$}0.03)eV for the energy level is well confirmed, the symmetry factor is determined as k=0.45, which represents an intermediate value among the scattered results from the literature. Additional spectroscopic information from the defect transformation allows both capture cross sections of the FeB defect to be determined (sigman=2.5\texttimes{}10\textendash{}15  cm2 and sigmap=5.5\texttimes{}10\textendash{}15  cm2). Being suggested as a fingerprint of iron in the literature, the crossover position of the Fei- and FeB-dominated IDLS curves (at 300  K) is experimentally proved to be doping dependent which is accurately predicted on the basis of the extracted set of Fei and FeB defect parameters. An additional fingerprint of iron is found by the qualitative change of the TDLS curve upon illumination and its S-like shape under dark conditions, which represents a robust criterion for unambiguous identification of iron in silicon. As the most sensitive technique to detect and determine an iron contamination in silicon heavily relies on the Fei and FeB defect parameters, the spectroscopic results are of special practical importance. \textcopyright{}2005 American Institute of Physics},

Zusammenfassung
Mittels Kapazit{\"a}tsmessung und Beobachtung des Zeitverhaltens des Stromflusses wurden die thermischen Emissions- und Einfangraten sowie die Ionisationsraten eingefangener Elektronen f{\"u}r Schwefeldonatoren im Bereich der Verarmungszone eines in Sperrichtung gepolten Silizium-pn-{\"U}berganges bestimmt. Die Methode der kleinsten quadratischen Abweichung liefert f{\"u}r die Emissionsrate des neutralen Donators en0t = 1,64 . 1010. (T/300 K)2 exp (-276/kT) sec und f{\"u}r den Fall einfacher Ionisation en-1t = 1,03 . 1012 (T/300 K)2 exp (-528/kT) sec, wobei kT in Einheiten von meV einzusetzen ist. Die thermischen Aktivierungsenergien betragen dementsprechend 276 und 528 meV. Die Emissionsraten f{\"u}r L{\"o}cher sind geringer und wurden nicht bestimmt. Die Abh{\"a}ngigkeit der Emissionsraten vom elektrischen Feld ist wesentlich kleiner als sie die Poole-Frenkel-Theorie liefert: en0t ist gr{\"o}{\ss}er um einen Faktor 1,5 bei 130 K (zwischen 0,2 und 1,0 . 105 V/cm), und en-1t um einen Faktor 2 bei 200 K. Die Einfangkoeffizienten f{\"u}r Elektronen wurden bei einer station{\"a}ren Elektroneninjektion in die Verarmungsschicht entweder {\"u}ber den Emitter eines Transistors oder durch optische Generation in der dem pn-{\"U}bergang n{\"a}chstgelegenen Oberfl{\"a}che aus dem Zeitverhalten der Kapazit{\"a}t bestimmt. Die Einfangrate f{\"u}r den doppelt geladenen Donator cn-2t nimmt unabh{\"a}ngig von der Temperatur von 5 . 10-7 cm3/s bei 3 . 104 V/cm auf 1 . 107 cm2/s bei 1 . 105 V/cm ab. Die Einfangrate cn-1t f{\"u}r den einfachen geladenen Donator lag bei 82 K etwa zwei Gr{\"o}{\ss}enordnungen unter dem Wert f{\"u}r cn-2t; sie zeigte jedoch keine Abh{\"a}ngigkeit vom elektrischen Feld. Die Sto{\ss}ionisationsrate f{\"u}r eingefangene Elektronen Zentren sowie ihre Feldabh{\"a}ngigkeit wurden ebenfalls bei 82 K ermittelt.},

  abstract = {Many impurities in silicon have multiple energy levels lying deep in the energy gap. Such impurities may determine electron and hole trapping and recombination under non-equilibrium carrier conditions. Models for the deep energy levels and for the capture processes are described. Experimental techniques for the measurement of electron and hole capture cross-sections are compared and their relative merits considered. The present knowledge of capture cross-sections of deep impurities in silicon is essentially confined to gold, indium and zinc. Recent studies of these are reviewed, and compared with cross-sections for (a) shallow impurities in silicon and (b) deep impurities in germanium.

Zusammenfassung
Viele Fremdatome in Silizium haben vielfache Energieniveaus tief in der Energiel{\"u}cke. Solche Fremdatome k{\"o}nnen das Einfangen oder die Rekombination von Elektronen und L{\"o}chern under Nichtgleichgewichtsbedingungen bestimmen. Es werden Modelle der tiefen Energiezust{\"a}nde und der Einfangprozesse beschrieben. Experimentelle Methoden zur Messung des Einfangquerschnitts von Elektronen und L{\"o}chern werden miteinander verglichen und ihre jeweiligen Vorz{\"u}ge betrachtet. Die derzeitige Kenntnis der Einfangquerschnitte tiefer Fremdatome in Silizium beschr{\"a}nkt sich im wesentlichen auf Gold, Indium und Zink. Neure einschl{\"a}gige Experimente werden zusammengestellt und mit den Einfangquerschnitten niedriger Fremdniveaus in Silizium und tiefer Fremdniveaus in Germanium verglichen.},

  abstract = {Silicon solar cells containing boron and oxygen are one of the most rapidly growing forms of electricity generation. However, they suffer from significant degradation during the initial stages of use. This problem has been studied for 40 years resulting in over 250 research publications. Despite this, there is no consensus regarding the microscopic nature of the defect reactions responsible. In this paper, we present compelling evidence of the mechanism of degradation. We observe, using deep level transient spectroscopy and photoluminescence, under the action of light or injected carriers, the conversion of a deep boron-di-oxygen-related donor state into a shallow acceptor which correlates with the change in the lifetime of minority carriers in the silicon. Using ab initio modeling, we propose structures of the BsO2 defect which match the experimental findings. We put forward the hypothesis that the dominant recombination process associated with the degradation is trap-assisted Auger recombination. This assignment is supported by the observation of above bandgap luminescence due to hot carriers resulting from the Auger process.},

The lifetime results from these techniques for intentionally iron-contaminated samples were analysed, in particular for the aspect of the injection-level dependency of recombination lifetime. Based on theoretical considerations, a method for the analysis of deep-level parameters combining constant photon flux SPV and Elymat measurements has been developed. This method is based on a detailed numerical analysis of the Elymat technique, including the Dember electric field, the characteristics of the laser beam, the transport parameters of the semiconductor and multilevel Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination kinetics. The results of the numerical simulation are applied to the analysis of recombination lifetime measurements on intentionally iron-contaminated samples. We compared numerical simulations and experimental results from SPV and Elymat for p-type samples using the classical acceptor level atEv +0.1 eV and the donor level of FeB pairs atEc -0.3 eV as recombination centre. Better consistency in the interpretation of the results has been found in the doping range 1014\textendash{}1016 cm-3 supposing theEc -0.3 eV level as predominant recombination centre.

  abstract = {Electron-capture rates in zero electric field at both zinc acceptor levels have been directly and accurately measured by the transient-capacitance techniques for the first time. The data elucidate two major outstanding questions in recombination physics: (1) It has been suspected for two decades that the carrier capture rates associated with many centers with multiple charge states were due to a local Auger mechanism. We show that this postulate can be experimentally tested by the double-pulse method, and in the case of Zn in Si the Auger effect plays a negligible role. (2) While several workers have stressed that the electronic barrier may be more important than the vibronic barrier in determining the temperature dependence of carrier-capture rates at repulsive centers below room temperature, the charge effect was usually ignored in the literature. We show that in the case of Zn in Si, tunneling through the screened Coulomb barrier controls the temperature dependence below 200 K and above which tunneling through the vibronic barrier becomes important. Overall, the effect of the electronic barrier below room temperature is predominant and it gives a temperature-dependent capture rate that can be easily mistaken as the occurrence of a multiphonon-emission mechanism. Failure to recognize the charge effect may result in fitting of trap parameters inconsistent with physical reality.},

The Hall effect yieldsEv+0.37 eV for Fei. The annealing behavior of levels related to Fe is investigated up to 160 \textdegree{}C. Iron participates in at least four different types of impurity states: Fe i , Fe-acceptor pairs, precipitations (formed above 120 \textdegree{}C) and an additional electrically inactive state, which is formed at room temperature.},

  abstract = {Electrically active centers in n-type magnesium-doped silicon crystals are studied by deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). Magnesium is introduced by diffusion from a metal film on the surface at 1100\textdegree{}C. It is found that two levels with a similar concentration of \textasciitilde{}6 \texttimes{} 1014 cm\textendash{}3 dominate in the DLTS spectrum; the value approximately corresponds to the interstitial magnesium (Mgi) concentration expected from diffusion conditions and published data on the Hall effect. The dependence of the electron emission rate from these levels on the electric-field strength agrees qualitatively with the Poole\textendash{}Frenkel effect, which indicates the donor nature of both levels, although the absolute value of the effect differs from theoretical value. The activation energies of these levels found by the extrapolation of emission rates measured at various temperatures to zero field are 112 and 252 meV, which coincides within the accuracy with energies of ground states of the first and second donor levels of Mg determined previously from optical absorption. Thus, it is shown that when using high-quality initial material and the selected diffusion mode, interstitial magnesium atoms are the dominant centers with levels in the upper half of the band gap.},

The concentration of these levels ranges from 1013 to 1014 cm-3. The junction leakage current comes from carrier generation at the deeper level in the depletion region. Phosphorus gettering was found ineffective in reducing the concentration of these quenched-in levels, but they are annealed out by very slow cooling (25\textdegree{}C/hr to 650\textdegree{}C then quench to room temperatures). The thermal emission and capture rates of electrons and holes at these levels are measured as a function of temperature and electric field by the junction high frequency capacitance and d.c. leakage current transient techniques. It is demonstrated that the detailed balance relationship does not hold. The origin of this double donor center is yet to be identified.},
