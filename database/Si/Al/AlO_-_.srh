  title: "Erratum on \u201CDetermining the defect parameters of the deep aluminium-related\
    \ defect center in silicon\u201D"
  DOI: 10.1063/1.3652753
  measurement_technique: DLTS, LS-I
  comments: This is an erratum on rosenits2008, as the capture cross section and defect
    concentration determined from LS-I were too small. A new fit was performed using
    two defects, holding the energy level and concentration from DLTS constant. A
    single defect fit was also attempted but was found not to be of low quality.
