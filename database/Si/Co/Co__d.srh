  measurement_technique: review, DLTS
  comments: Taken from table 1 in the appendix. The table only provides the majority
    carrier capture cross section. The majority carrier has been estimated from the
    position of the defect level. e.g. if higher than the intrinsic level, it is assume
    the majority carrier was electrons.

  title: Cobalt related defect levels in silicon analyzed by temperature- and injection-dependent
    lifetime spectroscopy
  DOI: 10.1063/1.2433743
  measurement_technique: LS-TI
  comments: An investigation of the temperature dependence of the capture cross section
    for electrons suggests that the underlying recombination process of the defect
    in the lower band gap half is driven by a two stage cascade capture with an activation
    energy of E = 52 +- 2 meV.
