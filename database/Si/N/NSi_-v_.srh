  title: 'Thermally activated defects in float zone silicon: Effect of nitrogen on
    the introduction of deep level states'
  DOI: 10.1063/1.5036718
  measurement_technique: DLTS-LCr
  comments: This is in reference to a defect in FZ silicon for thermal treatments
    between 400-800 degrees. Comments on complex nature of defects and assignment
    to chemical nature. Indicates this is likley to be related to Nitrogen and Vacancies.
    This is as in Nitrogen lean samples the defect does not appear in DLTS, and when
    Nickle is introduced into the samples it takes a substitutionary  (destroying
    a vacancy) and leads to lower amount of defects detected by DLTS.
  sample:
    growth: FZ
    dopant: phosphorus
