  comments: Quenched n and p-type silicon. Did not see resistivity change in n-type.
    The defect was observed to switch between two levels. This was confirmed with
    photoconductance data from Dash. The other level was Ec-0.55

  comments: the emission rate of holes was digitized from a graph. It differs from
    the quoted activation energy in the paper. This emission rate is very different
    from that of interstitial iron, also the instabilities were note seen.
