  title: Complete electrical characterization of recombination properties of titanium
    in silicon
  DOI: 10.1063/1.334095
  measurement_technique: DLTS-CrMe
  comments: Error in temperature coefficient of the values recorded here was not captured.
    This is the first demonstration of all rates measured with an electrical bias.
    They vaired the pulse height not the pulse width. They forward bias a diode rather
    than  optical bias. While in the paper that titanium has been refereed to as being
    substitutional atom, but the reference that follows only uses it as a suggestion
    rather than an assignment.

  title: Metal impurities in silicon-device fabrication
  DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-97593-6
  measurement_technique: review, DLTS
  comments: Taken from table 1 in the appendix. The table only provides the majority
    carrier capture cross section. The majority carrier has been estimated from the
    position of the defect level. e.g. if higher than the intrinsic level, it is assume
    the majority carrier was electrons. This value is different from others as it
    is an activation energy rather than the energy level.
