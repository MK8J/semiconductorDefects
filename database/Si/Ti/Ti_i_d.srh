  title: Complete electrical characterization of recombination properties of titanium
    in silicon
  DOI: 10.1063/1.334095
  measurement_technique: DLTS-CrMe
  comments: Error in temperature coefficient not captured, first demonstration of
    all rates measured with an electrical bias. They forward bias a diode rather than
    optical bias. They varied the pulse height not the pulse width. While in the paper
    that titanium has been refereed to as being substitutional atom, but the reference
    that follows only uses it as a suggestion rather than an assignment.

  DOI: 10.1063/1.343608
  measurement_technique: DLTS-Cr, Hall
  comments: Noted that could not vary the filling pulse, as it was too short and so
    reanalyzed the data of wang1984.
