  comments: Data from a review paper, taking many measurements at a range of temperatures.
    Points out DLTS is impact by capture cross section barrier heights, while EPR
    and hall affect measurements are not. At 55 K simga_e was 1.5e-13, sigma_p was
    2e-14 were reported.

  DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-57121-3
  measurement_technique: review, DLTS
  comments: Taken from table 1 in the appendix. The table only provides the majority
    carrier capture cross section. The majority carrier has been estimated from the
    position of the defect level. e.g. if higher than the intrinsic level, it is assume
    the majority carrier was electrons.
