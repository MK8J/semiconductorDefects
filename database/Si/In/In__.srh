  title: Photoconductivity in Indium-Doped Silicon
  measurement_technique: PC-S
  linked: In_s_a.srh
  comments: Points to the strange temperature coefficient. Maybe be due to a) iononisation
    of defects, b) recombination through higher excited Indium states and this would
    not be detected by PC.
  measurement_details:
    T: 77.5K, 90K, 90K
  params:
    sigma_h: 1e-13*exp(0.055/kT)

  measurement_technique: Review, infrared absorption
  linked: In_s_a.srh
  comments: The ionization energy was estimated using the observed excitation band
    of highest energy. Good agreement with the thermal value of Ev+0.16. This turned
    out to be an acceptor level
  params:
    Ed: Ev+0.16

  title: Transient Recombination of Excess Carriers in Semiconductors
  DOI: 10.1103/PhysRev.109.1086
  measurement_technique: LS-T
  linked: In_s_a.srh
  comments: Was not sure what the defect is, but it is in indium doped Silicon. This
    turned out to be an acceptor level
  params:
    sigma_e: 1.1e-14*T^(-1)
    sigma_h: 1.5e-9*T^(-2)
