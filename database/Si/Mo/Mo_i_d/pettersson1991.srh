DOI;10.1557/PROC-262-489. On Zhou's result of extra energy levels they say \"Although, in principle, this level could originate from three different defects we think there are good reasons to believe that the midgap level is a kind of process induced built-in defect which has to be studied further before a correct chemical identification can be performed.\"",
