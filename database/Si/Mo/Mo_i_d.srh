  title: Deep Levels Associated with Molybdenum in Silicon
  DOI: 10.1143/JJAP.30.L1837
  measurement_technique: DLTS, DLTS-Mo, LS-N
  comments: DLTS peak at 170K. Resistivity 10 Ohm.cm. For FZ Mo was spun on, and thermally
    diffused. For CZ it was introduced into the melt. Both dopants were used for CZ
    and FZ. Found 3 other levels related to Mo; Ev+0.27, Ec-0.34, Ec-0.58 and not
    Mo and dopant pairing.
  sample:
    growth: FZ, CZ
    dopant: boron, phosphorus

    in silicon
  DOI: 10.1088/0268-1242/6/4/002
  measurement_technique: DLTS, DC-S
  comments: DLTS peak at 180K. Capture cross section measured of 50 deg from 150 to
    200 deg. Claims not a substitutional site. In a similar publication showing the
    same data a year later. DOI;10.1557/PROC-262-489. On Zhou's result of extra energy
    levels they say "Although, in principle, this level could originate from three
    different defects we think there are good reasons to believe that the midgap level
    is a kind of process induced built-in defect which has to be studied further before
    a correct chemical identification can be performed."

  title: Physical Behaviour of 4d Transition Metal Impurity in Silicon
  DOI: 10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.38-41.457
  measurement_technique: DLTS
  comments: DLTS peak at 180K. Resistivity 1-300 Ohm.cm. DLTS. Irradiated some samples
    with electrons of energy 5MeV. Also saw an acceptor level at Ec-0.53. Claims this
    is a substitutionary site, other authors disagree.

    dopant: boron, phosphorous, Tin, aluminum, Gallium,

  title: Metal impurities in silicon-device fabrication
  DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-97593-6
  measurement_technique: review, DLTS
  comments: Taken from table 1 in the appendix. The table only provides the majority
    carrier capture cross section. The majority carrier has been estimated from the
    position of the defect level. e.g. if higher than the intrinsic level, it is assume
    the majority carrier was electrons.

  comments: Claims that is a substitutionary site. This work explain some values from
    Hamaguchi1991 and some unpublished work from K. Mishra at SunEdison Semiconductor
    Ltd. This might also also explain the values of Paudyal2010.
