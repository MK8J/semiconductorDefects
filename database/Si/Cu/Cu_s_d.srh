  comments: Copper was hard to manage as it precipiates. They saw two additional levels
    Ec-0.23 and Ev+0.45, but believe it was due to contaminants in the copper.

  comments: Taken from table 1 in the appendix. The table only provides the majority
    carrier capture cross section. The majority carrier has been estimated from the
    position of the defect level. e.g. if higher than the intrinsic level, it is assume
    the majority carrier was electrons.
