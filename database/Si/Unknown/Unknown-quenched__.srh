  DOI: 10.1016/0038-1101(74)90067-7
  measurement_technique: DLTS-Cr, TS-C
  comments: Defects quenched after temp >1200 deg. The two levels appear to be due to the same center and are very stable at room temperature. Have a strong field dependence. Capture rate measured at one temperature. One year later sah1975 said that this was not actual a quenched in defect but caused by heavily diffused surfaces.
  sample:
    growth: CZ
    dopant: phosphorous
    incorporation: thermal
    resistivity: 8
